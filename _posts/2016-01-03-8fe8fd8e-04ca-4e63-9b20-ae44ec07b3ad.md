This is a day you've been planning for a long time.  
Let's make sure it's just right. 

I'm JB... I've been providing wedding DJ/MC entertainment all over  
NorCal for 20 years. My no-gimmick, laid-back approach to  
weddings has thrilled brides and satisfied clients for years. No  
bad tuxedo, no cheesy one-liners, no chicken dance (unless you really  
want to do it).... just a friend with an awesome personality, a microphone,  
and the desire to make your special day the absolute best! Oh, and I can  
make you, your friends, and invited guests shake their butts, too.

I find that the couples that search for services like mine, aren't looking for the guy in the bad tuxedo pretending that HE is the life of the party, the "entertainment". Well, that's not me.

We serve not only Sacramento Weddings but surrounding areas.  Check out the links to the left and feel free to call, email, or even text for a no-obligation discussion about your big day. I'm looking forward to it! -  
JB
